# set_list

This project renders my favourite Boiler Room sets.

## Task  

Build a simple node server + React web app that displays information about your three favourite Boiler Room sets.

You don't need to use a database (just use plain objects in your server side code), but you should make a network request to your node server to fetch information about the sets (including but not limited to title, artist, and location), and then display them in a simple list. Y

ou can use any server/client setup you choose, but please keep it simple.
